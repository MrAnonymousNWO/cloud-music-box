# Vulnerability Notes & Mitigation (Dev-only)

This project currently has a **small number of high-severity vulnerabilities** found by `npm audit` that are part of development dependencies and therefore do not affect production runtime.

Summary (2025-11-29):
- 3 high severity vulnerabilities were reported by `npm audit`.
- The vulnerabilities are related to `eslint-config-next` -> `@next/eslint-plugin-next` -> `glob`.
- These are development-time dependencies (affect linting / code analysis), not runtime packages.

Decision (Adopted):
- Accept / quiet the warnings for now (Option 1) — the project will continue development while these are tracked.
- Major version upgrades to `eslint-config-next` (recommended by `npm audit`) may introduce breaking changes; these should be done carefully in a separate branch and thoroughly tested.

Recommended future actions:
- Periodically run `npm audit` to re-check vulnerabilities:
  ```bash
  npm run audit
  ```
- If you want to upgrade safely:
  1. Create a feature branch.
  2. Upgrade `eslint-config-next` and compatible dev deps (e.g., `next`) together.
  3. Run `npm install`, `npm run lint` and `npm run build` to verify and fix any linting issues.
  4. Open a PR and test CI workflows.
- Alternatively, consider adding Dependabot to keep dev dependencies up to date.

If you prefer, I can open a PR that upgrades `eslint-config-next` and handle the resulting fixes in a branch for review.
